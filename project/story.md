# üìú Story

### The beginning <a href="#the-beginning" id="the-beginning"></a>

Hi ! I'm Armand the maintainer and creator of Rem√®de. I created Rem√®de in October 2023 because I switched to an android phone, and the proprietary dictionary "Antidote" is only available on iOS phones.

Rem√®de is a synonym of "Antidote" and its goal is to provides a **free**, **open** and **collaborative** dictionary available for **any platform**.

My main goal was to provide a dictionary which is easy and pleasant to use ! I also wanted Rem√®de to have **his own database**.

### The application now

Rem√®de is a cross-platform dictionary application. You can browse and use in offline mode the Rem√®de dictionaries, but it also allows you to browse DICT servers, and to import your own dictionaries.

Rem√®de also includes **a corrector**, **a rimes dictionary** and **French sheets** ! It is more than a dictionary.

### The Rem√®de Project <a href="#the-concept" id="the-concept"></a>

Today, I want to create something bigger. With the Rem√®de Project, I want to offer everyone, everywhere a simple and pleasant universal dictionary experience, with access to free dictionaries.

The Rem√®de Project aims to develop free dictionaries resources and give access to the existing (or old) resources. The resources we distribute are always open and are for all use cases.

That's why we distribute our databases in many formats.

### My future goals <a href="#our-future-goal" id="our-future-goal"></a>

I want to save and preserve the world of free and open dictionaries resources on Internet.

The future goals is to make Rem√®de even more universal, by translating it to more languages, and making it compatible with other dictionaries format.
