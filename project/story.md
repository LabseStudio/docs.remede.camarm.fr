# üìú Story

### The beginning <a href="#the-beginning" id="the-beginning"></a>

Hi ! I'm Armand the maintainer and creator of Rem√®de. I created Rem√®de in October 2023 because I switched to an android phone, and the proprietary dictionary "Antidote" is only available on iOS phones.

Rem√®de is a synonym of "Antidote" and its goal is to provides a **free**, **open** and **collaborative** dictionary available for **any platform**.

### The concept <a href="#the-concept" id="the-concept"></a>

My main goal is to provide a dictionary which is easy and pleasant to use ! I also wanted Rem√®de to have **his own database**.

Rem√®de is a dictionary, but it includes **a corrector**, **a rimes dictionary** and **french sheets** ! It is more than a dictionary.

### Our future goal <a href="#our-future-goal" id="our-future-goal"></a>

I want Rem√®de to become completely cross-platform but also to support more languages !

In facts the software we built is really stable and evolutive and permits to build databases for another languages.

I'm also hyped to make Rem√®de as compatible as possible, to make its dictionaries compatible with other dictionaries clients, and on the other hand to make the Rem√®de application a universal dictionary client (with the DICT protocol mainly)

### For you <a href="#for-you" id="for-you"></a>

Rem√®de is built for you by his community. Any contribution is apreciated and you are free to donate any amount of money to support my word on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/camarm).

I hope Rem√®de is useful for you and will brings even more breathtaking functionnalities.
