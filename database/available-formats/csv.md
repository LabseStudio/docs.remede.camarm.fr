# CSV

The CSV files can be widely used. They contain the word in the first column, and its definition in the second column. The definition contains HTML.

### Download&#x20;

You can download the `.csv` format for each dictionary directly from the [Github Releases](https://github.com/camarm-dev/remede/releases/).

### How to convert

To convert Remède dictionaries databases to the CSV format, we first convert it to the DICT format ([dict.md](dict.md "mention")) and then to CSV using [pyglossary](https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary).
