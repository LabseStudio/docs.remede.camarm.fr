# ðŸŽ¶ Rimes

## How it work ?

RemÃ¨de is able to serve a **rhymes dictionary** using its database.

It uses the field **phoneme** to know which words ends with the same sound. The query looks like (with phoneme `e`)

```sql
SELECT * FROM dictionary WHERE phoneme LIKE '%e'
```

TODO: more precision with elide ect
