# üß∞ DICT Client

Rem√®de is able to communicate with dictionaries servers. The DICT protocol was created in 1997; it has been described in the [RFC2229](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2229). It is based on TCP/IP.

### How it works

The codebase contains a Dict Client view, which is able to explore dictionaries server.

{% hint style="info" %}
Because Javascript is not able to send TCP requests, we must use native code to send TCP request through sockets. Thanks to [Capacitor Plugins](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android/custom-code), we can easily call native Java code from our Typescript codebase.
