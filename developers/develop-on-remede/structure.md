# üìÅ Structure

{% hint style="success" %}
**Good practise**

To discover and understand the project structure, start a development server and try to modify some files and see what changes.
{% endhint %}

* `server.py`: Main API, made with Fastapi
* `data/`: [Dataset](../../database/database/dataset.md) and Rem√®de databases
* `app/`: Ionic project
  * `src/`: Vuejs project
    * `components` : Vue components for the interface
    * `data` : Static data like translations (see [translation.md](../../project/contributing/translation.md "mention"))
    * `functions` : Typescript file to interact with native API or manage the offline dictionary
    * `views` : The "views" (pages) of the application
  * `tauri-src/`: Tauri Project
  * `android/`: Android project, generated by [`@capacitor/android`](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android)
* `api-definition`: API to fetch Wictionary definitions (it's a git submodule)
* `scripts/`: Scripts to parse, generate and make migrations on the database.
* `convert` : Tools and scripts used to convert Rem√®de databases to other dictionaries formats
* `docs/`: The website and blog of Rem√®de. The documentation is at [labsesoftware/docs.remede.camarm.fr](https://github.com/LabseSoftware/docs.remede.camarm.fr)
* `corrector/`: Docker to run languagetool API
* `tts/`: Docker compose to run nanotts with opentts
* `builds/latest`: Latest builds for platforms (can be outdated...)

Of course, there are more folders...&#x20;
