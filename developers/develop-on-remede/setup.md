  Follow these steps to setup your development environment before developing on
  Rem√®de.

# üîå Setup

## Setting up Ionic framework

Rem√®de uses Ionic. You will install npm dependencies and requirements to start developing with Ionic.&#x20;

1. Make sure you have **node 18** installed.
2. Move to the `app/` folder
3. Install dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

4. Install Ionic

```shell
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

## Setting up mobile development - Android

Ionic framework let us build Rem√®de for native platforms with Capacitor. {: .fs-3 .fw-300 }

Developing for Android does not need special requirements. Just install npm dependencies.

See [Capacitor documentation](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android) for more information.

{% hint style="success" %}
Make sure you have Android Studio installed.
{% endhint %}

## Setting up mobile development - iOS

Ionic Framework let us build Rem√®de for iOS.

We do not build Rem√®de for iOs yet. Follow the [official Ionic documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/ios).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Rem√®de has not been tested yet on iOS ! Build and use it at your own risks...
{% endhint %}

## Setting up API development

Rem√®de has a public API written with FastAPI. {: .fs-3 .fw-300 }

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Install dependencies

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. [Fetch database](setup.md#fetch-database) so the API can serve it

## Fetch database

Rem√®de latest database is not served by git because it is too large... We host our database on our own servers.

To fetch the latest database, you can use `curl` or `wget` as you prefer...

{% hint style="warning" %}
Execute these commands at project root.
{% endhint %}

* With `curl`

```shell
curl -o data/remede.db https://api-remede.camarm.fr/download?variant=remede
```

* With `wget`

```shell
wget -O data/remede.db https://api-remede.camarm.fr/download?variant=remede
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Rem√®de used to store its databases on **Github LFS servers** but our quota has been exceeded... The databases which are still stored in git lfs are **outdated**.
{% endhint %}

## Git submodules

Rem√®de includes external projects to its codebase using git submodules... {: .fs-3 .fw-300 }

To fetch or update the git submodules, just pull the distant repository inside the submodule's directory:

For example :

```shell
cd api-definition && git pull origin main
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are pulling the submodules for the **first time**, you must execute
{% endhint %}

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**Lists of submodules :**

* `/api-definition`: [api-definition](https://github.com/LabseSoftware/api-definition)
